Jaguar I-Pace Price: The electric SUV is priced from Rs 1.05 crore to Rs 1.12 crore (ex-showroom).

Jaguar I-Pace Variants: It is available in three variants: S, SE, and HSE.

Jaguar I-Pace Seating Capacity: Jaguar’s electric SUV can seat up to five people.

Jaguar I-Pace Range, Electric Motors and Battery: The I-Pace utilises two electric motors, one on each axle, with a combined power output of 400PS and 696Nm. They can individually control the wheels, which means the I-Pace has an AWD system, courtesy of which it can go from 0-100kmph in just 4.8 seconds. The electric motors draw their power from a 90kWh-battery pack, which gives it a 470km range according to the WLTP cycle (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure). In the real world, we expect this number to drop below 400km.

Jaguar I-Pace Charging: With a 7.4kWh AC wallbox charger, the I-Pace can be charged from 0 to 100 percent in almost 14 hours. Using the more powerful 50kW DC charger, the I-Pace can be charged up to 100 percent in approximately two hours. Take that up to 100kW DC charging, and the I-Pace can replenish its capacity by 127km in just 15 minutes. The electric SUV’s system is capable of handling as high as 150kW of DC charging.
